dcp is a distributed config pushing tool

The intention is to have an admin host which holds a collection of
sparse directory for a variety of machines.

These are kept under version control and can be:
* pushed to the host
* compared to the host
* aligned with peers

Support two operational models:
* change the host and record later
* stage on the server and push

Need to:
  consider user that runs dcp has to have ssh root equivalence for rsync
  --fake-super ... but this makes changing ownership etc hard.

Using sudoers:
  Defaults env_keep+="GIT_AUTHOR_NAME, GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
to pass-through environment for git logs.

* dcp_init

  This command is run once to create a site area that holds each host
  as a git submodule. This isn't used yet.

* dcp_add_host

  This is used to create a git repository for a host. It also updates
  a host repository to use the latest hooks (eg to manage metadata).

  ?? Should this take a set of files to initialise (avoids the empty repo issue)
  ?? Should it update all hosts if used w/o a hostname

* dcp_pull_files

  The primary tool to update a repo from the remote host(s).

  usage: dcp_pull_files [-r] [-p] [-f] (-h <hosts_list> | <host> ) [<files>]
     Pull files tracked by dcp from host and commit them to the sparse tree
     -r  refresh files from host to repository
     -p  pull (and add) any pending files mentioned on the host
         in the /var/dcp/register file
     -f  Pull even if there are uncommitted changes which may be overwritten
     -h  <hosts_list> is a file containing list of hosts to push to
     <files> specified manually will be suject to a 'git add' and
             'git commit' if needed

  ?? Should this be renamed to dcp_update_repo

* dcp_push_files

  If files are updated on the repo then this command sends the repository files to the host(s)

  usage: dcp_push_files [-f] [-a] [-n] (-h <hosts_list> | <host>) [<files>]
    Push files tracked by dcp to host
    -a  Push all files in the tree (not default)
    -f  Push even if there are uncommitted changes
    -n  dry-run
    -h  file containing list of hosts to push to

* dcp_status

  Reports the git status for uncommitted local changes, metadata
  status for changes to file ownership, permissions etc and any files
  that are out of sync between the repo and the host.

  Can also show what files on the remote system are tracked.

    usage: dcp_status [-v] [-l] [<hosts>]
       Check status of hosts. Default to all hosts
       -v  Also show a git diff
       -l  Show current list of managed files instead of checking status of them
       -q
