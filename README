dcp is "distributed config pull" - a tool like etckeeper for a
collection of dissimilar machines.

Tools like puppet are great when you have lots of similar machines and
have the in-team resource to manage them. However they're a hard slog
to learn and to get to use.

dcp solves the problem "now". It simply used rsync to pull back the
installed package list and /etc (and any other files or areas) to a
central machine where git manages changes. Any changes can be tracked
and seen on the admin server and unexpected/unacknowledged changes
reported via email.

So the admin host holds a collection of sparse directories for a
variety of machines.

These are kept under version control and can be:
* compared to the host
* aligned with peers

It supports a simple operational model:
* change the host and record later

INSTALLATION

Add the following line to sudoers on the admin host:
  Defaults env_keep+="GIT_AUTHOR_NAME, GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
to allow a pass-through environment for git logs.
Ensure that sudo users of dcp have the variables setup.

Decide where tp store the config.
cat <<EOF > /etc/dcp.conf
HOST_STORE=/srv/dcp/store/hosts/
SITE_STORE=/srv/dcp/store/site/
EOF

Clean up if needed:
rm -rf /srv/dcp/store/

First setup (or update) your repository by running:

dcp_init

Now you want to add one or more hosts to dcp, so simply run:

dcp_add_host cocoa cocoa1 cocoa2 cocoa3

Usually you will want to start tracking a whole config dir in host cocoa

dcp_track_files  -r -m"Monitor /etc" cocoa /etc/

Now you want to start dcp watching the real files

dcp_pull cocoa
dcp_commit -m "Initial pull of remote files" cocoa


Now when you change a file on a host then :
  dcp_status cocoa
will show what's changed.

Then:
  dcp_pull cocoa
will bring all the changes to the store

When this is done execute :
  dcp_commit $host
to commit all changes.

If you only want to commit some files :
  dcp_commit $host -m"Updated fstab with new partition" /etc/fstab

If you only want to commit package installation changes :
  dcp_commit $host /etc/fstab



DOCUMENTATION

Up-to-date documentation is obtained from using --help on any command.

* dcp_init

  This command is run once to create a site area that holds each host
  as a git submodule. This isn't used yet.

* dcp_add_host

  This is used to create a git repository for hosts. It also updates
  a host repository to use the latest hooks (eg to manage metadata).

* dcp_track_files

  Adds files or directories to the list of files to rsync but does no
  data transfer. Used to add new areas beyond the base /etc/ tree and
  to filter out unwanted files.
  Currently supports:
  * specific files
  * -r allows files to be pulled recursively (eg /etc)
  * exclusion file (not tested yet)

  (needs to allow exclude editing)
  Forces a commit of the new filelist/dirlist/excludefile

* dcp_pull

  The primary tool to update a repo from the remote host(s).
  Pull files tracked by dcp from host to the sparse tree.
  Doesn't do any commits.

* dcp_commit

  By default commits manifest, all outstanding changed files and new files
  Can commit just certain files or manifest etc

* dcp_status

  Reports the git status for uncommitted local changes, metadata
  status for changes to file ownership, permissions etc and any files
  that are out of sync between the repo and the host.

  Can also show what files on the remote system are tracked.



store format:

${host}/
  files		     list of specific files pulled by rsync xfer
  dirs       	     list of dirs pulled recursively by rsync xfer
  exclude_patterns   list of exclusions applied to all rsync xfers
  metastore  	     holds file metadata (for now)
  sparse/    	     rsync'ed copy of remote tree
